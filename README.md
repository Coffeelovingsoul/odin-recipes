# odin-recipes

This is my first project from the course. 
I will have to use the skills and knowledge that I have gained so far.

Skills in command line terminal like making files and depositories. 
Using git comands to commit any changes and progress. 
Creating the boilerplate and using VS code to further add different elements to it.


My goal is to practice and exercise everything that I have learned 
and feel confident in those skills.
